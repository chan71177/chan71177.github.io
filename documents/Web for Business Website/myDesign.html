  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>C is for CONTRAST</td>
    <td>This is the readability of the page.  Being sure information is clearly visible.  In my page I have a busy background and, so I felt that it was necessary to have BOLD lettering.  I also filled in the text boxes so that the data will stand out as opposed to being blended with the background.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>R is for REPETITION</td>
    <td>This is the consistency of your website.  In my site design I have maintained the same background and Text, Text box colors throughout.  I have also kept my navigation in the same position.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A is for ALIGNMENT</td>
    <td>This is the flow and organization of your site.  Each of my website pages have a header that is centered.   Again, since I have used a busy background, I have chosen to have sections filled with color, so they stand out.  There are multiple rows of these boxes, each with less contrast than the row before.  </td>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P is for PROXIMITY</td>
    <td>I have applied this to my website by creating thick rows and justifying the text alignment. This will create a box or block feel.  Block rows are evenly spaced and centered below that.  Each subsequent row will also do the same.  Each color filled section or “box” has its own topic.   aa</td>
